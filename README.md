## Sensirion SFM3200 and SFM3400 library for Arduino

This library provides a lightweight interface to the Senserion SFM3400 and SFM3200 flow meters. It uses the Arduino Wire library to communicate with the flow sensors and is loosely based on the original Senserion library.

Original Senserion code can be found here: https://github.com/Sensirion/embedded-sfm
